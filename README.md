Cat Chase is a game where the cat (AI) chases the mouse (controlled by the player). In order to win, the mouse must escape to the green areas and can only move to spots without a black wall. However, the cat moves 2 spaces for every move the mouse/player moves. If the cat catches the mouse, the player loses!

How the AI cat plays:
The cat will try to move towards the mouse as quickly as possible. It will try to get into the same row or column as the mouse, and move towards the mouse's location until it catches it or loses. For example, if the mouse is below the cat, the cat will move down, and if the mouse is in the same row as the cat but to its right, the cat will move to the right.
